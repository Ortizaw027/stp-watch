## STP Smartwatch Firmware

The STP Smartwatch is a compact, wearable device built on the **ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.28 development board**. This simple smartwatch firmware provides a fully functional touchscreen interface, step tracking, a stopwatch, and battery monitoring. It is designed with modular, readable code, allowing users to easily adapt it as firmware for their own boards or reuse portions of the code for personal projects and experimentation.

## Version 2 – Coming Soon

- **Custom PCB & Enhanced Sensors** – High-accuracy heart rate, SpO₂, temperature, and advanced motion tracking for precise activity monitoring.  
- **Advanced Health & Activity Tracking** – Heart rate monitor, improved step counter, and gesture detection.  
- **Optimized Power Management** – Efficient firmware and dynamic sensor control for longer battery life.  
- **Watch Face & Theme** – Improved UI theme that keeps energy consumption low(Potentially customizable UIs).  
- **Mobile App Integration** – Sync data, configure settings, and receive notifications directly from your smartphone.

## Version 1 Features

### Real-Time Clock
Displays the current time on your watch using either the internal clock or synchronized network time. Always shows the correct hour and minute in a simple, readable format.

### Graphical User Interface
Smooth, visually appealing screens built with LVGL. Navigate between different “tiles” or pages using swipe gestures on the touchscreen.

### Touch Input
Capacitive touch allows easy interaction. Swipe to switch screens and interact with watch features without buttons.

### Step Counter
Counts your steps using the built-in accelerometer/gyroscope. Tracks motion when worn on your wrist to estimate daily activity.

### Stopwatch
Simple start, pause, and reset functionality. Provides visual feedback directly on the watch screen.

### Battery Percentage Display
Shows the battery level on all screens in a consistent position above the main content. Updates in real-time so you know when to recharge.

### Modular Codebase
Drivers and UI components are separated to make the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP32-S3 microcontroller** with integrated Wi-Fi/Bluetooth  
- **1.28-inch round GC9A01 LCD display**   
- **CST816S capacitive touch controller**  
- **Onboard IMU sensor** for motion detection and step tracking  
- USB-C connection for power, charging, and flashing  

> This firmware was designed specifically for the ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.28 development board and may not work on other ESP32 variants without modification.

## Flashing Instructions

1. Install the [ESP-IDF framework](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/get-started/index.html) on your computer.  
2. Connect your ESP32-S3 board via USB-C.  
3. Open a terminal in the firmware project directory.  
4. Configure the project (adjust serial port if necessary):  
   ```bash
   idf.py set-target esp32s3
   idf.py menuconfig
5. Build the firmware:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
6. Flash the firmware to the board:
   ```bash
   idf.py flash
7. Monitor the output to ensure it boots correctly:
   ```bash
   idf.py monitor
8. After flashing, the watch should start displaing the default UI
